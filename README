## Software

It is recommended to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), which contains the Python interpreter and the Jupyter Notebooks. 

## Download Cloudnet data

Cloudnet data is stored on www.pangaea.de. One needs to run get_cloudnet/download_data.py to download data for LWC, LWP, IWC, reff_Frisch and reff_ice. get_cloudnet/merge_data.py reads the data from the downloaded netCDF files and merges all data of one day into one file.

## Compare results

Go to compare_TCWret_and_Cloudnet and run the Jupyter-notebooks. TCWret data is stored in data_TCWret.
